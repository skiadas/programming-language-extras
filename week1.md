1. Write a function `alternate(nums : int list) -> int` that takes a list of numbers and adds them with alternating sign. For example `alternate([1,2,3,4]) = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 = -2`
2. Write a version of `date_to_string` that writes `1st`, `2nd`, `3rd` etc for the day, instead of just `1`, `2`, `3`
3. Write a function `min_max(nums : int list) -> int * int` that takes a non-empty list of numbers, and returns pair `(min, max)` of the minimum and maximum of the numbers in the list.
4. Write a function `cumsum(nums: int list) -> int list` that takes a list of numbers and returns a list of the partial sums of those numbers. For example `cumsum([1,4,20]) = [1,5,25]`.
5. Write a function `greeting(name: string option) -> string` that given a name string returns the string `"Hello there, ...!"` where the dots would be replaced by the name. Note that the name is given as an option, so if it is NONE then replace the dots with `"you"`.
6. Write a function `repeat(nums: int list, times: int list)` that given a list of integers and another list of nonnegative integers, repeats the integers in the first list according to the numbers indicated by the second list. For example: `repeat([1,2,3], [4,0,3]) = [1,1,1,1,3,3,3]`
7. Write a function `addOpt(int option, int option) -> int option` that given two "optional" integers, adds them if they are both present, or returns NONE if at least one of the two arguments is NONE.
8. Write a function `addAllOpt(int option list) -> int option` that given a list of "optional" integers, adds those integers that are there (i.e. adds all the `SOME i`). For example: `addOpt([SOME 1, NONE, SOME 3]) = SOME 4`. If the list does not contain any `SOME i`s in it, i.e. they are all `NONE` or the list is empty, the function should return `NONE`.
9. Write a function `any(exps : bool list) -> bool` that given a list of booleans returns `true` if there is at least one of them that is `true`, otherwise returns `false`. If the list is empty it should return `false`.
10. Write a function `all(exps : bool list) -> bool` that given a list of booleans returns `true` if all of them `true`, otherwise returns `false`. If the list is empty it should return `true`.
11. Write a function `zip(xs : int list, ys : int list) -> (int * int) list` that given two lists of integers creates consecutive pairs, and stops when one of the lists is empty. For instance `zip([1,2,3], [4, 6]) = [(1,4), (2,6)]`.
12. Challenge: Write a version `zipRecycle` of `zip`, where when one list is empty it starts recycling from its start until the other list completes. For instance `zipRecycle([1,2,3], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) = [(1,1), (2,2), (3, 3), (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), (1,7)]`.
13. Lesser challenge: Write a version `zipOpt` of `zip` with return type `(int * int) list option`. This version should return a `SOME list` when the original lists have the same length, and `NONE` if they do not.

EDIT: Here's some more:

1. Write a function `lookup: (string * int) list * string -> int option` that takes a list of pairs `(s, i)` and also a string `s2` to look up. It then goes through the list of pairs looking for the string `s2` in the first component. If it finds a match, it returns the corresponding number `i` as an option. If it does not, it returns `NONE`.
2. Write a function `splitup: int list -> int list * int list` that given a list of integers creates two lists of integers, one containing the non-negative (0 or bigger) entries, the other containing the negative entries. Relative order must be preserved: All non-negative entries must appear in the same order in which they were on the original list, and similarly for the negative entries.
3. Write a version `splitAt: int list * int -> int list * int list` of the previous function that takes an extra "threshold" parameter, and uses that instead of `0` as the separating point for the two resulting lists.
4. Write a function `isSorted: int list -> boolean`, that given a list of integers determines whether the list is sorted in increasing order.
5. Write a function `isAnySorted: int list -> boolean`, that given a list of integers determines whether the list is sorted in either increasing or decreasing order.
6. Write a function `sortedMerge: int list * int list -> int list` that takes two lists of integers that are each sorted from smallest to largest, and merges them into one sorted list. Example: `sortedMerge([1,4,7], [5,8,9]) = [1,4,5,7,8,9]`
7. Write a sorting function: `qsort: int list -> int list` that works as follows: Takes the first element out, and uses it as the "threshold" for `splitAt`. It then recursively sorts the two lists produced by `splitAt`. Finally it brings the two lists together. (Don't forget that element you took out, it needs to get back in at some point). You could use `sortedMerge` for the "bring together" part, but you do not need to as all the numbers in one list are less than all the numbers in the other.
8. Write a function `divide: int list -> int list * int list` that takes a list of integers and produces two lists by alternating elements between the two lists. Example: `divide([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]) = ([1,3,5,7], [2,4,6])`
9. Write another sorting function: `not_so_quick_sort: int list -> int list` that works as follows: Given the initial list of integers, splits it in two lists using `divide`, then recursively sorts those two lists, then merges them together with `sortedMerge`. You can call it something other than `not_so_quick_sort` if you like ;)
10. Write a function `fullDivide: int * int -> int * int` that given two numbers `k` and `n` it attempts to evenly divide `k` into `n` as many times as possible, and returns a pair `(d, n2)` where `d` is the number of times while `n2` is the resulting `n` after all those divisions. Examples: `fullDivide((2, 40)) = (3, 5)` because `2*2*2*5 = 40`; `fullDivide((3,10)) = (0, 10)` because 3 does not divide 10\.
11. Using `fullDivide`, write a function `factorize: int -> (int * int) list` that given a number `n` returns a list of pairs `(d, k)` where d is a prime number dividing `n` and `k` is the number of times it fits. The pairs should be in increasing order of prime factor, and the process should stop when the divisor considered surpasses the square root of `n`. If you make sure to use the reduced number `n2` given by `fullDivide` for each next step, you should not need to test if the divisors are prime: If a number divides into `n`, it must be prime (if it had prime factors, they would have been earlier prime factors of `n` and thus reduced earlier). Example: `factorize(20) -> [(2,2), (5,1)]`; `factorize(36) = [(2,2), (3,2)]`; `factorize(1) = []`.
12. Write a function `multiply: (int * int) list -> int` that given a factorization of a number `n` as described in the previous problem computes back the number `n`. So this should do the opposite of `factorize`.
13. Challenge (hard): Write a function `all_products: (int * int) list -> int list` that given a factorization list result from `factorize` creates a list all of possible products produced from using some or all of those prime factors no more than the number of times they are available. This should end up being a list of all the divisors of the number `n` that gave rise to the list. Example: `all_products([(2,2), 5,1]) = [1,2,4,5,10,20]`. For extra challenge, your recursive process should return the numbers in this order, as opposed to sorting them afterwards.
